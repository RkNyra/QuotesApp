##### By **Rhoda Kimanga (RK Nyra)**

### Description
This is a quote sharing and voting app [Quotes] (insert quote-app live link here) where users can share their favorite inspirational quotes and get to vote on other quotes from other users. You can view it [Quotes] (insert quote-app live link here).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.4.


### Setup/Installation Requirements
* Github account - from where the site's source-code and live-site can be viewed and downloaded
* Git installed in pc - for downloading the site to view it locally i.e. on one's device
* Text Editor e.g. Visual Studio or Atom - for making viewing and editing the code.
* Browser e.g. Google Chrome - which can be used to open the index.html file once it has been downloaded

###### Development server
* Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

###### Code scaffolding
* Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build
* Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


### Behavior Driven Development
1. On getting to the landing page, a user is able to view quotes shared by other users and view the respective quote up-votes and down-votes.
2. The user is also able to add their own quote by clicking the 'add quote' button and filling in the form that appears after clicking this button.
3. The user then fills in the form details which are all required-inputs; i.e. the quote, quote-author and submitted by-name. The user then submits the form.
4. On submiting the quote-input-form: -
  * the form gets hidden, 
  * the user's quote details are appended on the page/added as the last item on the quote display area; i.e. the user gets to view the quote they submitted as the last item in the quote-display-area, and
  * the app also displays information on when the quote was created and submitted by respective users.

5. The app also allows users to up-vote or down-vote on any quote on the page. This is achieved using the upvote and downvote buttons that appear at the bottom of each quote that is displayed.
6. On clicking any of the vote buttons, the app is able to count the number of upvotes and/or downvotes on the subject quote and display these numbers below each respective vote-button.
